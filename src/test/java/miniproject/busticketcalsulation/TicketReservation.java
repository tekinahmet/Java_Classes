/*
    Project: app that calculates bus ticket price based on distance and conditions
        Distance from User (KM), age and trip type (One-Way) OR  Round-trip (Going&Returning)
        Get seat number information.
        All buses should have a seat number in total "32".
        Take the payment as 1 USD / km per distance. (*2 for Round-trip trip)
        First, calculate the total price of the trip and then apply the following rules to the customer according to the conditions;
        Values received from the user must be valid (distance and age are positive numbers, trip type is 1 or 2).
        Otherwise, "You Have Entered Wrong Data!" or Any warning should be given.
    1- If the person has chosen the "Journey Type" Round-trip trip, 20% discount is applied on the ticket price.
    2- Single Seat Fee:
        If the seat number is 3 or a multiple of 3, the ticket price is increased by 20%.
    3- Age discount:
        If the person is younger than 12 years old, 50% discount is applied on the ticket price.
        If the person is between the ages of 12-24, a 10% discount is applied on the ticket price.
        If the person is over 65 years old, a 30% discount is applied on the ticket price.

        1)HashMap is not "thread-safe" and is not "synchronized"
        2)Learn and explain HashMap Mechanism
            i)When you create a HashMap, Java gives you 16 "bucket"s
            ii)Java indexes every bucket from 0 to 15
            iii)When you put a new entry into the map,
                    a)Java creates hashcode for the key
                    b)Divides the hashcode by 16 then remainder is the index of the bucket
            iv)Java puts the entry into the bucket whose index is found in "iii.b"
            v)If Java needs to put multiple entries into a bucket, Java uses "Linked List" structure inside the bucket
            vi)If "75%" of  the existing buckets is full Java creates a new 16 buckets
            v)To find an entry Java follows the following steps
                Bucket --> HashCode --> Key --> return value
